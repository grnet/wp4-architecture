# Regulatory and Foundational Alignment
The WE BUILD project is anchored in a  legal framework designed to reduce administrative burdens and strengthen the Single Market. Our architectural choices are driven by two key mandates: [Regulation (EU) 2024/1183](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1183/oj/eng) for natural persons and the [European Business Wallet proposal](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A52025PC0838) for economic operators.

Technical development follows mandatory rules such as the Article 5 revocation requirements and the "Business-Wallet-by-Default" principle, ensuring our infrastructure supports future Union initiatives.

[To be added]
<!-- EUDI Wallet Mandate: Regulation (EU) 2024/1183, which mandates the issuance of wallets to natural persons at Level of Assurance (LoA) High. CIR still on its way, will be reopened.
EBW Proposal: COM(2025) 838 proposal. Explain that the EBW is intended for economic operators and public sector bodies to exchange data with full legal effect. CIR to come.

### Revocation Mandate
Our implementation of identity revocation is anchored in Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 Article 5 that sets the legal baseline for personal identification data (PID) revocation. Similarly, the European Business Wallet (EBW) proposal extends these trust requirements to legal entities. These regulations ensure that when a identity is no longer valid or secure, it is removed from the ecosystem immediately

## Architectural Principles
- **Interoperability:** This is our primary goal, ensuring that different wallet providers, issuers, and verifiers can communicate seamlessly across borders and different sectors. 
- **Reusability:** WE BUILD is designed to maximize efficiency by building upon existing EU digital infrastructures and successful results from previous Large Scale Pilots. 
- **Security-by-design:** Security is integrated into the architecture from the start, aiming at following the strict mandates for Level of Assurance (LoA) High for citizens and Substantial for business transactions. 
- **Privacy-by-design:** While business interactions require transparency and traceability, we need to ensure that users maintain sole control over their data.
